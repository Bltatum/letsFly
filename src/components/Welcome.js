      Welcome to Let's Fly. Let's Fly makes finding pilots to fly with much
      easier. You can look through the flights to find one you may be interested
      in and send the poster a message or you can post a flight yourself. You
      can also search for pilots you already know and send them a direct
      message. Fly safe and remember to keep the blue side up! Happy Flying.
