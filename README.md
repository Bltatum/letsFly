# Let's Fly
Lets Fly is a single page Application that easily allows Pilots to connect with other Pilots to fly with. Pilots are social people who enjoy flying with others for company and safety. This app allows pilots to post future flights for which they are looking for a co-pilot. The co-pilot need could be for a safety pilot, instruction, split-time or just have someone in the right seat for company. Rather than sending out a mass text or calling multiple people you can simply post a future flight on the Flight Board by  filling out a form with the flight details. Pilots can also look at Flight post to see if there is a flight they would be interested in and send that user a direct message..
